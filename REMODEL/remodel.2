Hi Walt and Jerry....

Here is yet more info and questions to fnalize details
of everything:

- On the topic of where the sun tunnel should be, 
it will not be possible to move it towards the master
bedroom area since the roof accesss panel is there. 
How about this suggestion...  please leave the existing
hall light as is.  Move the NEW hall light down more towards
the 3rd bedroom and place the sun tunnel in the middle 
of the new corridor...

- If your choice of the exhaust fans is Nutone LS80LF,
which is 80CFM and 0.8 sones and 26 watt fluorescent
light, that is great.  We will use this in BOTH
bathrooms.  If however, this is not the exact model,
please tell us about the details such as noise rating and
light power.  Please confirm this.

- we will forego the epoxy grout since u guys are not 
familiar with it. 

- Can u give us an approx time when u require
the solar panels off the roof ?  We do not obviously
want to take them down too early so that we can maximize
their use in the summer...

- Can we make the guest bathroom door 6 panel solid wood
so that we can screw towel holders/hooks to the back 
of it without going thru hollow panels ?

- Could u please make the center of the decorative
tile trim in the MASTER bathroom shower 
at 63" from the floor ?  I believe u have it
currently at about 61".

- Also we would like the shower bar's centre to 
be at 63".  The shower bar we have selected is the 
Hansgrohe Unica B model which is 25" long.

- The models and brands of all fixtures are to follow soon..
We are in the process of finalizing that list.  The list
will also include the paint colors too.


GUEST BATHROOM DETAILS:
----------------------

- We would like the toilet roll holder placed on the half wall.

- We want a small medicine cabinet placed above the toilet
flush tank. Its dimensions are approx 22.5"w x 27"h x 10"d.
At the bottom, it has a towel holder.  Since the towels should
not dangle on the toilet tank, cabinet should be placed such that
its bottom clears the top of the toilet tank by about 20 inches.
With the current toilet we have chosen, this brings the bottom of
the cabinet at about (32 + 20) = 52 inches.
It will not be recessed.  It should be centered above the
toilet unit.  So, please build whatever stud structures are needed
to carry this.

- Above the vanity (on 2 walls) we would like 2 mirrors.
One of those mirrors will be above the vanty backsplash and
the other immediately adjoining on the right wall.
Do we purchase these and if so, we would like to know the
maximum allowed dimensions.

- There wont be a towel bar in the guest bathroom.  Instead
we would use hooks at the back of the guest bathroom door.
Therefore, we would like this door to be of solid wood so
that we can screw in the hooks properly.  We also discussed
this above.

MASTER BATHROOM DETAILS:
------------------------

- For the medicine cabinet to be placed above the vanity, we have
2 choices.  However, we are not quite sure if the dimensions
are acceptable since it looks like one choice pushes the limits.

     - one cabinet is 48"w x 30"h x 5"d .  I was not sure
       if this would be too big for the space we have there.
       Could u please advise if this is doable ?
       (This would be placed in recess mode).

     - the second cabinet is 36"w x 31"h x 5"d.  I am sure
       this would definitely fit.  Again, this is recessed
       placement.

- Toilet roll holder will be at the same place as is now,
i.e. on the LEFT wall as we look at the toilet from the front.

- The double towel holder bar will also be at the same
place as is now, under the window.

- We will also have a round towel holder/ring at the same place
as is one now, under the shower light switch, at the 
same level slightly above the middle of the backsplash
level.  This needs to be just hi enuf so it just clears
the drawers opening without blocking their motion, but not
much higher.  Note we are having the "tall" (I believe 34")
vanity unit in the master bathroom.

- We need to actually sit down and I need to draw exactly
how the shower fixtures will be placed......  let us set
up an appointment for that please.
