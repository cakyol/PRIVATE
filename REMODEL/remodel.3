- in the master bathroom, the floor vent is right under
  our foot when sitting on the toilet.  It needs to move
  back in by about 10 inches or so.  Jerry already knows
  about this.

- in the 2nd bedroom, u have added new pole and shelf
  to the closet.  That is NOT needed.  All the existing
  removable shelves should be reused.  This should save
  some cost.

- we do not need gutters all around the house.  Only in
  the new section.  This should save some cost.

- We wanted an extra phone jack and power strip in the
  study as we discussed on our wed meeting

- the 3 way switch in the living room needs to control
  the entry hall lite and not the bedroom hall lite, as
  we discussed on our wed meeting.

- In your sheetrock section, in the bathrooms, u mention
  that half inch wallboard will be used.  Are these the
  concrete & fiberglass wallboards instead of the sheetrock ?

- Also, there is no mention of the floating mud base for all
  tile work anywhere.  I presume that all tile work, including
  the floor tiles will be done on a floating mud base.  Please
  confirm.

- Same for the hot mop shower...  Is this indicated anywere
  for the master bathroom shower ?

- There is no mention of who supplies the guest bathroom
  over vanity wall to wall mirrors (one on top of vanity
  and the other on the right hand wall).  Shirley mentioned
  that u would take the measurements for precise fitting but
  I am not sure who actually buys them....  Please clarify.

- In the materials list, the guest bathroom cabinet seems
  to be missing.  Also, I would like to emphasize that the guest
  bathroom cabinet is of standard height and the master bathroom
  cabinet is 2" higher.

- The two minor sheetrock repairs, one in the garage and the
  other in the sunken living room, dont seem to be in the
  "green" list altho they are on the plans.  Just fyi...
