Hi Jerry and Walt,

Here are some questions and last minute
suggestions:

- In the master bathroom, I dont think we need a new door
  as indicated in the plan.  Why cannot we use the old door ?

- The linen cabinet door in the 2nd bathroom should just
  be an orinary white 6 panel door.  Only the two bathroom
  cabinets should have the linen front.  This saves cost.
  We already told this to Shirley, has shenot conveyed 
  it to you yet ?

- I cannot see the heat vent in the master bathroom, does
  it stay at the same place ?

- The height of the bathroom vanity in the guest bathroom
  should bethe standard/low height (32 inches I think), for
  kids reachability.  Themaster bathroom vanity should be
  taller at 34 inches.  Again, we already told this to 
  Shirley in our last meeting.

- who provides door knobs and drawer handle hardware 
  for the vanity units ?

- can we actually see the new front bedroom window ?
  or at least can we have a picture of it ?  It is
  difficult to approve it unless we havea good idea
  of what it looks like.

- Also, what kind of sliding doors will u be installing
  for the 3rd bedroom cabinet doors ?  How can we see
  and approve them ?

- We already saw the guest bathroom outside door.  I presume
  it is the Andersen 400 series outswing patio door ?
  Is it just a frame with just full glass ?  Please make
  sure that the glass is obscure.  Also, we want the
  solid bright brass handle on it.....

- still not decided on the floors.  However, we are
  heavily leaning towards the wood fllor.  Please
  quote us excluding the floor work since we already
  have your quote on this as a separate item.

- do we supply the mirrors/medicine cabinets in the bathrooms ?

- During demolition, please make sure that all the 
  gardening sprinkler valves are not thrown but
  given to us since we will use those again eventually.

- when new gutters are tied into the existing gutter
  system, we would like them to be plumbed into the
  already exisring underground system.  Please also
  be aware that the cable tv cable actually travels
  inside that pipe so care should be taken when messing
  in that area.

- Why are the bathroom exhaust fans not exactly over
  the shower and bath tub to maximize moisture suction ?
  If posible, could u please place them exactly above the
  shower center and the bath tub center ?

- In the 3rd bedroom, we would like a power outlet
  inside the alcove next to the cupboard area.  This
  is s that when we put a chest of drawers there, we
  can use a light on top of it.

- I cannot see any phone jacks in the plans ?  Could we
  have a phone jack in every baedroom please ?

- Please do not forget to repair the small sheetrock in the
  sunken living area just behind the step adjoining
  it to the family room.  Will u indicate this in the
  final plans ?

- Thereis also another very small sheetrock job to
  be done in the garage just where the washing machine
  plumbing is located.

- We have a power switch at the living room near the
  heating system thermostat and we never figured out
  what that controls.  If itis unused, could it be connected
  to control the hall light in a 2 way system ?

- We do not want a hose bibb at the front of the house.
  Instead, we would like one at the back, at the external
  wall near the guest bathroom.  

- can u install insulation in the inside wall between the master
  bedroom shower and the actual bedroom.  I know this is an
  inside wall but it would be for sound insulation only
  and we are aware of that.

- on the new concrete porches (at the front and the side of
  the bathroom, can we have a light sand colored concrete instead
  of the boring gray color ?
    
- On the plans, I have not seen the crawl space access hatch.
  Where will that be ?  We would prefer that to be in the 
  entry hall closet.  However, if there is obstruction
  underneath that, how about the 2nd bedroom closet ?

- In the 2nd bedroom now, we have a lot of shelving already
  installed in the closet space.  Is CKD going to remove these
  during demo and re-install them after construction or
  do u want us to remove them ?

- Could u please give us the price of the front window for
  the 3rd bedroom so that we can compare it to the current
  line of windows we are using ?  We currently use the
  all aluminum white Windstar windows.

Here aresome really fiddly details I would like to also
discuss.  I am not sure if we have to sit down face to face
and draw these or should I list them here anyway:

- In the master bathroom we would like the BOTTOM of the
  fixed shower head to be at 75 inches from the floor.

- We want the shower tiles and the bath tub surround tiles
  to go all the way to the ceiling completely.

- when can we get together for us to give u a drawing
  of how the shower faucets/fitments should be placed
  in the shower and bath tub since there are quite a 
  few components we should think about.

- We would like an alcove both in the master bedroom shower
  and in the guest bathroom tub to place shampoos/soaps etc.
  This should be about 16 inches wide by about 12 inches clear
  height.  In the shower, it should be placed at the center 
  of the widest wall where there are no fixtures and in the 
  bath area it should be placed on the wall OPPOSITE the shower
  head.
