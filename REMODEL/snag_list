outside front
-------------

- on the front porch, where the gutter butts against the
  siding, there is a severe leak that has been leaking
  all the time it has been raining.  The water is running
  down the siding continuously.  That needs a very good
  caulk.

main entry hall
---------------

- on the left side of the main door, in the thin sliver of
  sheetrock, towards the top end, there are some scratches
  that need to be finished more carefully.

- again on the left side of the door, this time half
  way on the sheetrock, towards the left, there is a hammer
  mark damage that need fixing.

Jant overheard John mentioning that these may have been there 
before CKD.  I assure u that is not the case.  These happened
when CKD was trying to retrofit the garage stuff and had to cut
a big piece of sheetrock from the hall to gain access to the
garage.

main hall 
---------

- at the corner of the wall where the heating thermostat is,
  at the bottom, just next to the hall closet door, some
  sheetrock mud has fallen off, which probably cannot be 
  covered by baseboard.  It needs remudding and paint.

- there are staple marks left from putting up the "caution"
  tape across the hall, on left side of the hall wall,
  (towards the kitchen side), they need to be spackled
  and painted.

garage
------

- the corner metal flashing is missing in the garage at
  the kitchen door/landing corner.  It is all the way
  to the ceiling and needs to be installed.  This is where
  the old termite damage was....

study
-----

- the study closet floor is still loose.  It needs to be
  completely and firmly fixed by the time flooring people
  arrive on the 18'th.

- in the study closet back wall, there are still some holes,
  cuts and dents which need to be finished much more
  carefully.

- somehow, the louvred doors for that closet seem a bit too
  wide for me.  The gap is roughly 64", but each door is
  about 21" wide, making it 84" wide...  Am I mistaken ?

guest bath
----------

- inside the closet, basebaord needs installing.

- there are 2 distinct hammer marks to the left of the
  outside door, which show as big dents on the sheetrock,
  which need remudding/refilling and repainting.  When light
  hits that area, it shows up really badly.

- the top drawer of the vanity has bubbling paint on it,
  the finish neeeds to be sanded/cleaned.

- again for the same vanity, the trim t the right of
  the same drawer also has a blemish on it which needs
  refinish.
