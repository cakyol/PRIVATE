Hi Don,

I am a bit worried about the little things that need to be
finished up before the first phase of the project is completely
over.  I am somehow not sure if u guys will be able to finish
it on the 11'th since I feel a sense of slowdown in the work.

Can we please set up a meeting either monday or tuesday
sometime since I will be going back to work starting wed. 

The below items need to be completely done by the end of the
first phae since it would not be very wise to do these
during the second phase when the floors are down.  Basically,
I would not want any workers trapsing in and out of the floored
areas once the new flooring is down...

- the cedar lined seating box in the 3rd bedroom

- the small sheetrock piece in the sunken living room
  just around the single step which needs to be repaired.

- the shelving in the study

- the shelving in the baby room closet

- the shelving in the guest bathroom closet

- some more caulking still needs to be done around the floor tiles
  in the guest bathroom, especially around the cast iron tub.

- there is a gap where the tile floor meets the vanity/
  heating vent toekick in the guest bathroom.  That needs to 
  be addressed.  It will probably need a trim piece since caulking 
  that big of a gap will not be appropriate.  I would have preferred
  if the tile had completely been pushed under the vanity.
  That way, it would have looked much nicer.  Hopefully,
  it will be done that way in the master bathroom.

- the mirrors in the guest bathroom.

- the granite top trim for the half wall and the backsplash

- the crown molding on the entry hall ceiling

- all the internal painting

- concrete porch at the front

- the concrete landing outside the guest bath room.

- and of course all the plumbing and electrical fixtures
  in place after the interior painting is done.

on the outside, I would like the following finished especially
before any rains start:

- all the downspouts are still not done

- at least 2 additional downspouts need to be installed
  on the front.  I want to be present for the placement
  of those if possible please since we need to determine
  their location carefully

- exterior painting, especially of the masonite siding
  and exposed parts of the wood, especially before the
  first rains hit

- Joe Wickersham mentioned that he was going to paint
  the inside of the gutters with some industrial grade
  paint to guard against corrosion.  The gutters are already
  filling up with crap and I presume this needs to be done
  before the rains start.

Thanx for your attention....

Gene & Janet
